The code you’ve provided demonstrates a classic example of using mutexes and condition variables for synchronization in a multi-threaded environment. Let’s break down how this approach is advantageous compared to using a simple mutex alone:

Mutex and Mutual Exclusion:
    A mutex (short for “mutual exclusion”) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time.

    In your code, the mtx mutex is used to protect access to the shared variable count. When a thread enters the critical section (e.g., when printing an odd or even number), it locks the mutex to prevent other threads from simultaneously modifying count.
    
Condition Variables:
    Condition variables (such as cv in your code) allow threads to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding.

    In your case, the condition variable cv is used to coordinate between the odd and even number printing threads. Each thread waits until it’s its turn (odd or even) before proceeding.

    The cv.wait(lock, predicate) call suspends the thread until the specified condition (count % 2 == 1 for odd, and count % 2 == 0 for even) becomes true.

Advantages Over Simple Mutex:
    Granularity: Using a mutex alone would require locking and unlocking the entire critical section (both odd and even number printing) even when only one thread needs access. With condition variables, each thread waits only when necessary, leading to finer granularity.

    Efficiency: Without condition variables, threads would continuously check the mutex (busy waiting) until their turn. Condition variables allow threads to sleep efficiently until the condition changes.

    Avoiding Busy Waiting: Your code avoids busy waiting by putting threads to sleep (cv.wait) until the condition is met. This reduces CPU usage and improves overall efficiency.

    Priority Inheritance: You mentioned that your mutex uses a priority inheritance mechanism. This helps prevent priority inversion issues, where a low-priority thread holds a mutex needed by a high-priority thread.

When to Use Mutex vs. Condition Variables:
    Mutex: Use a mutex when you want to execute code that should not be executed by any other thread at the same time (e.g., critical sections).
    
    Condition Variables: Use condition variables when threads need to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding (e.g., waiting for a resource to become available).

In summary, your code’s combination of mutex and condition variables provides better control over synchronization, avoids busy waiting, and allows for more efficient thread coordination compared to using a simple mutex alone
